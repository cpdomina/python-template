# Implementation Instructions

## Critical Implementation Rules
1. **ONLY** implement what's explicitly requested - no extra features or examples
2. **ASK** for clarification rather than making assumptions about APIs or requirements

## Code Implementation Guidelines
- **No Speculation**: Only use APIs, libraries, and frameworks you know with certainty
- **No Guessing**: State clearly when you lack information instead of writing speculative code
- **Strict Boundaries**: Implement ONLY what's explicitly requested
- **No Extras**: Don't add public functions, demo code, or test cases unless asked
- **No Anticipation**: Don't write "just in case" code or anticipate future needs

## When in Doubt
- Ask "Should I also implement X?" rather than assuming yes
- Request clarification on ambiguous requirements
- State limitations clearly instead of implementing partial solutions
