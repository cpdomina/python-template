## Code Implementation
- Only use APIs, libraries, and frameworks you know with certainty
- If you don't know how something works, don't write speculative code
- State clearly when you lack sufficient information instead of guessing
- Ask for clarification rather than implementing based on assumptions


## Strict Request Boundaries
- **ONLY** write the exact code that is explicitly requested - nothing more, nothing less
- **DO NOT** write additional public functions, methods, or classes beyond what was asked
- **DO NOT** write example usage, demo code, or test cases unless explicitly requested
- **DO NOT** write "extra" functions that you think might be helpful
- **DO NOT** anticipate future needs or write "just in case" code
- When in doubt, ask "Should I also write X?" rather than assuming yes
